	// does this offset by setting bit 7 (i.e. adding 0x4000). We would need to figure some way
	// to replace this hopefully without having to rewrite the whole engine as changing it to the
	// 8th bit (0x8000) would be too high as there is currently only 0x3667 bytes of space before
	// the end of the text block. Also there may be other data after that that we can shift back
